### Setup

1. Clone this repository and change working directory:
```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules -j5 https://github.com/anarchuser/Capstone;
cd Capstone
```

2. Install dependencies:
```shell
./configure
```

3. Run the project:
```shell
make
```

### How to play

The game itself is simple - fly the spaceship using `WASD` or `arrow keys` without colliding with anything. Once your health points reach 0, you die.  

From the main menu you can also join another player on a remote machine in the same local network. To play together one player starts a game instance and all others connect to the IP address of the first machine.

Pressing `Escape` in-game opens a menu that allows you to restart, disconnect, and close the game.
